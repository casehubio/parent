**GitHub:** [casehubio/clinical](https://github.com/casehubio/clinical)
**Tier:** Application
**Status:** Active — Layers 1–5 complete; Layer 6 blocked on engine#112

## What It Is

A clinical trial coordination application built on the CaseHub agentic harness. Coordinates eligibility screening agents, safety monitoring agents, PI authorisation gates, and IRB approval gates across multiple trial sites — producing an FDA-compliant, GDPR-aware, independently verifiable audit trail. Field showcase and tutorial for Java developers in regulated healthcare (pharma, biotech, clinical research).

GCP domain knowledge is a prerequisite for this audience — and it is standard knowledge for Java developers in that field. The same developer who evaluates CaseHub for their trial coordination system is the developer who follows the tutorial to build it.

Scored 24/25 on market fit — highest of all evaluated use cases. Demonstrates that GCP, FDA, and EMA requirements cannot be met by workflow-based LLM coordination and are structurally satisfied by CaseHub's foundation.

Comparison baseline: ClinicalAgent (arXiv 2404.14777, ACM BCB '24, open source). See `docs/use-case-analysis.md` §8.1 and `docs/tutorial-strategy.md` §7 in this repo.

## Tutorial Layers

The tutorial structure emerges from the natural adoption sequence. Each layer adds one foundation module and makes its value tangible relative to the previous layer. The code at every layer is production-grade. See `docs/tutorial-strategy.md §7` for teaching objectives per layer.

| Layer | Adds | Gap it closes | Status |
|-------|------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Naive Java — no CaseHub | Baseline: direct service calls, no SLA, no audit | complete (Epics 1+2, 2026-05-08) |
| 2 | casehub-work | No formal SLA for adverse event review (GCP: serious AE within 24h) | complete (Epic 4, 2026-05-12) |
| 3 | casehub-qhorus | No formal obligation when coordinating PI authorisation and safety agents | complete (Epic 5, 2026-05-15) |
| 4 | casehub-ledger | No FDA tamper-evident audit trail; no GDPR Art.17 consent withdrawal | complete (Epic 4, 2026-05-12) |
| 5 | casehub-engine | Fixed trial pipeline; no adaptive paths for grade-based escalation or IRB gates | complete (Epic 6, 2026-05-23) |
| 6 | Trust routing | No trust model; experienced safety agents not prioritised on complex CTCAE Grade 4+ events | blocked on engine#112 |
| 7 | Comparison vs ClinicalAgent | — | pending |

## What It Owns

- Clinical trial domain model: `ClinicalTrial`, `TrialSite`, `PatientEnrollment`, `ProtocolDeviation`, `AdverseEvent`, `IrbApproval`
- Capability tags: `eligibility-screening`, `safety-monitoring`, `protocol-review`, `irb-consultation`, `pi-authorisation`, `data-safety-monitoring`, `regulatory-submission`, `trial-supervisor`
- Trust dimensions: `safety-accuracy`, `eligibility-precision`, `protocol-adherence`
- Multi-site trial `CasePlanModel` — site-level sub-cases with trial-level aggregation
- Adverse event escalation — 24h/7d GCP SLA WorkItems with CTCAE grading
- PI authorisation — formal COMMAND creates Commitment; deviation requires named PI approval; MAJOR deviations trigger GCP §4.5 sponsor notification via `SponsorNotifier` SPI (casehub-connectors-core)
- IRB/ethics committee gate — `ClinicalDeviationCaseHub` + `deviation-review.yaml`: CRITICAL protocol deviation + PI approval → 72h WorkItem → four terminal outcomes (APPROVED/REJECTED/DEFERRED/EXPIRED); `IrbDecisionListener` bridges WorkItem lifecycle to `IrbApproval` entity + ledger
- AE escalation policy SPI — `AdverseEventEscalationPolicy` + `DefaultAdverseEventEscalationPolicy` (CTCAE-based): Grade 3 → senior monitor gate; Grade 4+ → senior monitor + DSMB in parallel; `ClinicalAdverseEventCaseHub` + `ae-escalation.yaml` drives adaptive routing via `contextChange.filter`
- 3-site showcase scenario vs ClinicalAgent

## The Compliance Gap It Closes

ClinicalAgent (peer-reviewed baseline) structurally cannot provide:
- Adverse event SLA enforcement (GCP: serious events within 24h) — WorkItem `claimDeadline`
- Protocol deviation authorisation by named PI — COMMAND commitment lifecycle
- Consent withdrawal (GDPR Art.17) — ledger erasure and decision context sanitisation
- Multi-site independence with trial-level rollup — sub-case orchestration
- FDA tamper-evident audit trail — Merkle MMR + Ed25519-signed checkpoints
- Trust-weighted safety agent routing — Bayesian Beta from outcome attestations
- Adaptive protocol paths — IRB gate and grade-based AE escalation via casehub-engine `CasePlanModel`
