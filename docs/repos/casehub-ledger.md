## Purpose

Domain-agnostic, immutable, cryptographically tamper-evident audit ledger for any Quarkus application. Zero knowledge of business domain. Consumers extend it; it never extends them.

---

## Key Abstractions

### Core Model

| Concept | Role |
|---|---|
| `LedgerEntry` | Abstract base entity for all tamper-evident audit records |
| `LedgerAttestation` | Peer verdict record (SOUND / FLAGGED / ENDORSED / CHALLENGED) with confidence and evidence |
| `ActorTrustScore` | Per-actor trust score keyed by actor, capability, and dimension; supports Bayesian and continuous score types |
| `LedgerMerkleFrontier` | Stored MMR frontier enabling incremental Merkle tree operations per subject |
| `ActorIdentity` | Token-to-identity mapping for pseudonymisation |

See `docs/DESIGN.md` for field model and entry type vocabulary.

### Services

The ledger provides services for: cryptographic verification and inclusion proofs, Merkle tree operations (RFC 9162 MMR), optional Ed25519 tlog-checkpoint publishing, W3C PROV-DM lineage export, GDPR Art.17 token-severing erasure, nightly trust score recomputation with CDI routing events, trust score read-model export, and trust bootstrapping for new actors.

See `docs/DESIGN.md` for service class structure.

### SPIs (Consumer-Implemented or Built-In Alternatives)

| SPI | Default | Built-in Alternative | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LedgerEntryRepository` / `ReactiveLedgerEntryRepository` | — | JPA default | Persistence for ledger entries |
| `ActorTrustScoreRepository` | — | JPA default | Persistence for trust scores |
| `ActorIdentityProvider` | — | JPA default | Tokenise / resolve / erase actor identities (GDPR) |
| `DecisionContextSanitiser` | no-op | — | Sanitise PII from decision context JSON before storage |
| `LedgerTraceIdProvider` | OTel span | — | Override OTel trace ID extraction |
| `TrustImportService` | no-op default | JPA default (seed-if-absent) | Import trust scores from external payload |
| `TrustBootstrapSource` | no-op default | — | Fetch prior trust data for first-time actors |

### Supplements (Optional Attachments)

| Supplement | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ComplianceSupplement` | GDPR Art.22 / EU AI Act Art.12 decision fields |
| `ProvenanceSupplement` | Data lineage — source entity, workflow reference |

### Flyway Migrations

Path: `classpath:db/ledger/migration` (moved from `classpath:db/migration` in ledger#95).
Consumers must add this path to their `quarkus.flyway.locations` config.

| Version | Contents |
|---|---|
| V1000 | `ledger_entry` + `ledger_attestation` tables |
| V1001 | `actor_trust_score` table |
| V1002 | Supplement tables |
| V1003 | `ledger_entry_archive` table |
| V1004 | `actor_identity` pseudonymisation table |
| V1005 | `agent_signature` + `agent_public_key` columns on `ledger_entry` |
| V1006 | `agent_key_ref` column on `ledger_entry` |
| V1007 | `key_rotation_entry` subclass table |

**Consumers** own V1008+ for their own subclass join tables (V1004–V1007 are now ledger base).

## Depends On

Nothing in the casehubio ecosystem. Quarkus + Hibernate ORM only.

## Depended On By

| Repo | How |
|---|---|
| `casehub-work` | Optional ledger module — extends `LedgerEntry` to record work item events |
| `casehub-qhorus` | Mandatory — extends `LedgerEntry` to record agent messages; provides ledger write integration |
| `casehub-engine` | Optional ledger module — extends `LedgerEntry` to record case events |
| `claudony` | Transitively via Qhorus and casehub-ledger |

## What This Repo Explicitly Does NOT Do

- Provide REST endpoints (consumers define their own)
- Provide MCP tools (consumers define their own)
- Capture domain events (consumers wire their own `@ObservesAsync` observers)
- Replay events or project CQRS views
- Know anything about WorkItems, Cases, or agent channels

---

## Consumer Pattern

Consumers:
1. Extend `LedgerEntry` as a JPA `@Entity` (`@DiscriminatorValue`)
2. Add their own Flyway migration (V1004+ range) for the subclass join table
3. Wire a CDI observer to capture domain events as ledger entries
4. Optionally attach `ComplianceSupplement` or `ProvenanceSupplement`

See `docs/DESIGN.md` for the leaf hash scheme.

---

## Agent Identity Convention

Format: `{model-family}:{persona}@{major}` — e.g. `"claude:tarkus-reviewer@v1"`.  
Major version bump resets trust baseline to Beta(1,1) = 0.5 prior.  
Bump criteria: model family change, persona behaviour change, scope change. Do NOT bump for: bug fixes, tuning, CLAUDE.md changes that don't alter behaviour.

---

## Current State

- 449 tests passing, native image validated
- Reactive/blocking service parity enforced at build time via `BlockingReactiveParityTest` (ArchUnit 1.4.1) — auto-discovers all `Reactive*Service` classes and asserts bidirectional method parity and `Uni<T>` returns
- All epics complete: MMR, PROV-DM, privacy/pseudonymisation, EigenTrust, trust routing signals, OTel auto-wiring
- No deployed production instances — schema migrations can be rewritten in place (no incremental migration scripts needed)
- Quarkiverse submission pending (eligibility discussion ongoing)
